        <p>The internet is at the same time better and worse than it used to be before I was born.</p>
        <p>We don't need huge websites and massive frameworks to convey ideas.</p>
        <p>We don't need excessive images, styling and scripts.</p>
        <p>Fancy CSS is still nice, but only if you drop unused code instead of including all of Bootstrap or something.</p>
